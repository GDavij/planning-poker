# Sprint Poker

This project aims to support enterprises that wanna to self-host application to manage their planning by free just requiring a infra and a Identity Provider (AD, OAuth, etc...).

## Inspiration \(WHY\)

In my work we have every sprint the cerimony of planning to define new features to agregate bussiness value and the team is considerabily huge, the application we currently use does not support more than 6 people limiting the number of people that are able to contribute with points and points of view for every task, story, epic.

I hope that this application solves the problem of limit of users during a sprint planning cerimony or other Scrum cerimony which consists to give points and points of view.
